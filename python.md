# Python Tutorial

    - install python
    - install integrated developement enviornment ie PyCharm, VSCode
      - this is a software that helps us write other software

## Create New Project

    - Go onto IDE and create new project
      - Name project "Hello World"
    - Terminal window
    - print a message
      - print('Hello World') -- run -- see terminal window of printed string
      - print("Hello World") -- run -- see terminal window of printed string

## Variables - Pt 1
    - a variable = container for a value. behaves as the value that it contains
    - 4 basic datatypes
      - strings (str): which store a series of characters 
      - integers (int): which store a whole number 
      - floating point number (float): a numeric vlaue with a decimal
      - booleans (bool): which only store True or False, very useful with if statements
        - ie x = 2 + 5 x = 7
    - variable string "Hello"
    - variable integer 21
    - variable float 2.5 
    - variable boolean false/true
  - You can combine variables together as long as they are of the same datatype

- the reason you may want to use booleans instead of str even though you can still store a str representation of the word false or true is that, these are very useful when we get to if statements. we can check to see if some statement is true/false
