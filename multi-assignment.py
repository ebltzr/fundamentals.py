# standard assignment

# name = "Pickle"
# age = 29
# attractive = True

# print(name) # Pickle
# print(age) # 29
# print(attractive) # True

# another way to do the above code is to use multiple assignment this allows us to assign multiple variables @ the same time using one line of code

# name, age, attractive = "Pickle", 29, True
# print(name, age, attractive) # Pickle 29 True
# print(name) # Pickle
# print(age) # 29
# print(attractive) # True


# #lets say we have four variables
# Spike = 30
# Ein = 30
# Faye = 30
# Jet = 30

# print(Spike) # 30
# print(Ein) # 30
# print(Faye) # 30
# print(Jet) # 30

# do this in one line of code -- multiple assignment
Spike = Ein = Faye = Jet = 30
print(Spike, Ein, Faye, Jet) # 30 30 30 30
print(Spike) # 30
print(Ein) # 30
print(Faye) # 30
print(Jet) # 30
